This folder contains example documents from past teams that we consider are of high quality. 
Use them as a rough guideline, not as a template.

As a general note: try to keep your documents **concise**. That is: short but descriptive.
The sad truth of the world is that people do not like to read large documents, and if your document is not being read you are wasting valuable development time ;).

## Requirements Document
The requirements document should be self contained and should  also make sense to somebody who is not part of the team. Thus it should have a high-level introduction that explains the importance and the scope of the project. But the most important role of this document, is that it will be the evolving shared understanding between you and the customer. Thus, the more details it contains the more can you be sure that you are on the same page. And this is why we ask you to update it after every meeting with the customer. 

For the requirements, it is important that you note **why** the requirement should be implemented. As the reason will give context to the person implementing it. Have a look at the [Hestia](Hestia%20-%20Requirements%20Document%20Iteration%207.pdf) document if you want an example of how to do this using **User Stories**: _as an X I would like to Y so I can Z_. This will also make it easier for you to transfer your requirements document into a product backlog tool such as [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) or the [Github Project Board](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) (and vice-versa).

### Example structure:
- **A nice cover**:
...will make the us happy. Add the project title, the client, the team names, TA name and the document version.
- **Brief introduction**:
A high-level introduction that explains the importance and the scope of the project. Explanation of the document structure.
- **Critical Functional Requirements**:
Requirements that your client would be very angry about if they are missing in the final product.
- **Important Functional Requirements**:
Requirements that would disappoint your client if they were missing in the final product.
- **Useful Functional Requirements**:
Requirements that your client would be happy about if they were implemented, but it's OK if they are not.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
All requirements that describe a certain _quality_ of the product, such as "Intuitive design" or "Android support". Be sure to properly understand the distinction between functional and non-functional (_a large part of students initially lose points due to this mistake!_).
- **Won't Do**:
Features you will not implement. Noting what you _will not_ do is just as important as noting what you _will_ do.
- **Meeting Log**:
A log of all meetings with the client and the decisions made there. Each requirement should have been discussed. This will help you with forgetful clients.
- **Change Log**:
Descriptive list of changes made to the document tagged with date and author.

## Architecture Document
The goal of this document is to allow you to present the architecture of what you have already but also what you are aiming at. (e.g. if you plan to use Angular on the front-end, but didn’t start using it yet, do mention this). One of the goals of this document is to make sure that the SE Staff has a good overview of what everybody is doing so we can offer you *the best advice* :)

### Example structure:
- **A nice cover**:
...will make the us happy. Add the project title, the client, the team names, TA name and the document version.
- **Brief introduction**:
A brief introduction to the product, highlighting the specifics that influence the architecture and design choices.
- **Architectural overview**: 
What components are there and what are their functions?
How are components connected/communicating?
If a more general principle or a paradigm is applied that is worth mentioning, mention it.
- **Technology Stack**:
What programming languages are being used? What technologies are being used (Frameworks, libraries, platform, peripherals)? If different components have different technologies, present them individually. 
- **Team Organization**:
What teams are there and what are their responsibilities?
Are the team responsibilities focused on different components? 
- **Change Log**:
Descriptive list of changes made to the document tagged with date and author.

## Presentation
Your presentation will allow you to showcase your project to teaching assistants, students, and anyone who is interested. It is meant to invoke interest in your work and to give some rough insights in your developments process.
Also: try to make it **captivating**! Nobody will listen to a boring slideshow.

Some tips:
- Speak with a clear, calm and audible voice.
- Stand straight, face the audience, do not run around too much.
- Be (or at least seem) interested in the story yourselves.
- Slides are meant to support your story, not to be the story itself.
- Presenting with too many speakers can be distracting.
- Introduce secondary speakers.
- Have a proper and clear ending. No _"and.... yeah that's it."_.
- Recorded demo's are  preferred, do not bore the audience by navigating through menus and pressing the wrong buttons.
